# Metaballs 2D

## Before we start
This project is based on following articles:
1. "[Metaballs and Marching Squares](http://jamie-wong.com/2014/08/19/metaballs-and-marching-squares/)" by [Jamie Wong](https://github.com/jlfwong)
2. "[Marching Squares Implementation](http://www.tomgibara.com/computer-vision/marching-squares)" by Tom Gibara
3. "[Polygonising a scalar field](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/)" by [Paul Bourke](http://paulbourke.net/)
4. "[Metaballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs)" from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)

Special thanks to [@aptem336](https://github.com/aptem336) for helping me to seek for information and realizations of similar projects.

## Definition
Metaballs are organic-looking objects that can be defined as a function in n-dimensions [4].

I'm gonna show you the way to code 2D metaballs and explain some math-related stuff.

## Math

As long as we work with two dimensions here comes a simple equation which is used to define the objects [1]:
