## Definition
Metaballs are organic-looking objects that can be defined as a function in n-dimensions [4].

I'm gonna show you the way to code 2D metaballs and explain some math-related stuff.

## Math

_Based on Jamie Wong article listed above_

As we have two dimensional metaballs the problem is to find all the points inside a circle limited by its bounds. Letâ€™s look at equation defining a circle with center at (x0,y0) and radius r:

If we want to model all the points inside circle including its bound:

Having all the interacting circles we can model all the points inside them if a circle of i is defined with center at (xi,yi) and radius ri:

And finally we get the equation defining two dimensional metaballs:
